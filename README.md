# Pokedex

Allegro - Summer e-Xperience 2020

Pokedex was prepared as a recruitment task at Allegro Summer e-Xperience 2020. The whole project consists in displaying a list of pokemon and some detailed information. The list of pokemon is taken from pokeapi.co. The application uses Bootstrap to generate an appearance. Pokemon are displayed as a list of 20 items per page. The application has the functionality of filtering pokemon by type. After filtering, all results are presented on a single page. Pokemon details can be seen by clicking the "Show more" button, and hide them by clicking the "Hide details" button.

To start the application, download the folder, and then run `npm start` in the downloaded folder in the terminal. Then open `http: // localhost: 8888 /` in your web browser.
